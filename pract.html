Lyrics<br><br>
I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So, honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone, you and me in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head, when we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something, yeah!
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head, when we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Yeah! (I really, really, really, really, really, really like you)
(And I want you, do you want me)
Yeah I need to tell you something (Do you want me, too?)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
